# Hello world - Domain Driven Design
The practice of Domain Driven Design is an industry wide well accepted practice to use in software engineering.
It focusses at putting the problem domain first, identifying and establishing the language used within the problem domain (referred to as the ubiquitous language).
Typically multiple problem domains are interacting with each other in order to add value to a business.
These might have their own language, where a Bounded Context can be identified where a ubiquitous language applies for a certain set of problems.
